# 🌐 Nuka Cola Front Page Store



Try to imagine an universe in which Nuka Cola sells their stuff online. Here's how I imagined it, with the most recent flavour being Nuka Cola Quantum.

### 🚀 What I've used 

The project is made with vanilla javascript, CSS3 and HTML5. I used Blender to make the Nuka Cola Quantum bottle and render the different image layers used in the 3D parallax header. GIMP was used to edit some images and icons.
